A Taste of Bioinformatics:
Exploring the Pathogenetics of Clostridium botulinum
https://stud.epsilon.slu.se/20182/1/trudova-e-2024-06-26.pdf

This interdisciplinary thesis investigates Clostridium botulinum and botulism disease, spanning
molecular biology, epidemiology, bioinformatics as well as clinical diagnosis and treatment. It
delves into the morphology, genetics and environmental distribution of Clostridium botulinum,
highlighting its adaptive strategies and spore formation and germination. This research aims to
provide a comprehensive understanding of botulinum toxins, BoNT A-G by application of
bioinformatic strategies to information gathering, information analysis and in silica methods, when
researching protein interactions involved in intoxication. This study conducted a representative
selection of BoNT strands, to visualise in silica relationship between toxins classified as BoNT AG with a multiple sequence alignment of selected strands using Clustal O (1.2.3). Data was analysed
for phylogenetic relationships among these strains. The results are organised, to highlight
similarities and differences across the strains in relationship, providing figures for “Clustal
highlight”, “Positive”, “Negative” and “Hydrophobicity” regions in sequences. Data collection
included analysis of available data from different databasessuch as NCBI, PDB and UniProt. Protein
structure of the BoNT/A Hall strain, protein database entry 2nyy, was visualized using PDB and
BioPython.
